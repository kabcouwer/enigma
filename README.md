# Enigma - self assessment

- This project can successfully encrypt and decrypt methods and the command line interface has been successfully implemented. I most proud of my classes and how I've organized the project into logical components. I believe I've gone above expectations for ruby conventions and mechanics. The code is appropriately named for easy understanding and no method is more than 10 lines long. I used TDD correctly and each method is tested individually and running with no failures. Finally, test coverage metrics show 100% coverage. In conclusion, I'd give this project a 3-3.5
